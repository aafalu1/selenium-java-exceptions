Exceptions in selenium java
1.	TimeoutException: This exception occurs when a command in Selenium does not complete
    within the specified time limit. This can happen when the page is taking too long to load
    or the element is not present on the page.
2.	NoSuchElementException: This exception occurs when an element is not found on the page using
    the given selector. This can happen when the selector used to locate the element is incorrect
    or the element is not present on the page.
3.	StaleElementReferenceException: This exception occurs when the referenced element is no longer
    available on the page. This can happen when the page is reloaded or the element is removed from the DOM.
4.	ElementNotVisibleException: This exception occurs when an element is present on the page but is not visible.
    This can happen when the element is hidden behind another element or its visibility is set to false in the CSS.
5.	ElementNotSelectableException: This exception occurs when an element is not selectable, such as when it is
    disabled or read-only.

8.	InvalidSelectorException: This exception occurs when the selector used to locate the element is

    another element on the page, such as a modal dialog box.
10.	ElementNotInteractableException: This exception occurs when an element is not interactable
    or is not in a state that can be interacted with, such as when it is disabled or read-only.

In general, Selenium exceptions occur when there is an issue with the page, the element being located,
or the command being executed. These issues can be caused by a variety of factors, including
slow network connections, server errors, incorrect selectors, or unexpected changes to the page structure.
By understanding the causes of these exceptions, you can better troubleshoot issues and write more reliable
Selenium tests.
